Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```solidity\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n *     }\n * }\n *\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.

If only one oracle is used, this creates a single point of failure and opens a vector\n * for attacking the protocol.\n *\n * The Resilient Oracle uses multiple sources and fallback mechanisms to provide accurate prices and protect\n * the protocol from oracle attacks. Currently it includes integrations with Chainlink, Pyth, Binance Oracle\n * and TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) oracles. TWAP uses PancakeSwap as the on-chain price source.\n *\n * For every market (vToken) we configure the main, pivot and fallback oracles. The oracles are configured per\n * vToken's underlying asset address. The main oracle oracle is the most trustworthy price source, the pivot\n * oracle is used as a loose sanity checker and the fallback oracle is used as a backup price source.\n *\n * To validate prices returned from two oracles, we use an upper and lower bound ratio that is set for every\n * market. The upper bound ratio represents the deviation between reported price (the price that’s being\n * validated) and the anchor price (the price we are validating against) above which the reported price will\n * be invalidated. The lower bound ratio presents the deviation between reported price and anchor price below\n * which the reported price will be invalidated. So for oracle price to be considered valid the below statement\n * should be true:\n\n```\nanchorRatio = anchorPrice/reporterPrice\nisValid = anchorRatio <= upperBoundAnchorRatio && anchorRatio >= lowerBoundAnchorRatio\n```\n\n * In most cases, Chainlink is used as the main oracle, TWAP or Pyth oracles are used as the pivot oracle depending\n * on which supports the given market and Binance oracle is used as the fallback oracle. For some markets we may\n * use Pyth or TWAP as the main oracle if the token price is not supported by Chainlink or Binance oracles.\n *\n * For a fetched price to be valid it must be positive and not stagnant. If the price is invalid then we consider the\n * oracle to be stagnant and treat it like it's disabled.\n */\ncontract ResilientOracle is PausableUpgradeable, AccessControlledV8, ResilientOracleInterface {\n    /**\n     * @dev Oracle roles:\n     * **main**: The most trustworthy price source\n     * **pivot**: Price oracle used as a loose sanity checker\n     * **fallback**: The backup source when main oracle price is invalidated\n     */\n    enum OracleRole {\n        MAIN,\n        PIVOT,\n        FALLBACK\n    }\n\n    struct TokenConfig {\n        /// @notice asset address\n        address asset;\n        /// @notice `oracles` stores the oracles based on their role in the following order:\n        /// [main, pivot, fallback],\n        /// It can be indexed with the corresponding enum OracleRole value\n        address[3] oracles;\n        /// @notice `enableFlagsForOracles` stores the enabled state\n        /// for each oracle in the same order as `oracles`\n        bool[3] enableFlagsForOracles;\n    }\n\n    uint256 public constant INVALID_PRICE = 0;\n\n    /// @notice Native market address\n    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable\n    address public immutable nativeMarket;\n\n    /// @notice VAI address\n    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable\n    address public immutable vai;\n\n    /// @notice Set this as asset address for Native token on each chain.This is the underlying for vBNB (on bsc)\n    /// and can serve as any underlying asset of a market that supports native tokens\n    address public constant NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDR = 0xbBbBBBBbbBBBbbbBbbBbbbbBBbBbbbbBbBbbBBbB;\n\n    /// @notice Bound validator contract address\n    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable\n    BoundValidatorInterface public immutable boundValidator;\n\n    mapping(address => TokenConfig) private tokenConfigs;\n\n    event TokenConfigAdded(\n        address indexed asset,\n        address indexed mainOracle,\n        address indexed pivotOracle,\n        address fallbackOracle\n    );\n\n    /// Event emitted when an oracle is set\n    event OracleSet(address indexed asset, address indexed oracle, uint256 indexed role);\n\n    /// Event emitted when an oracle is enabled or disabled\n    event OracleEnabled(address indexed asset, uint256 indexed role, bool indexed enable);\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Checks whether an address is null or not\n     */\n    modifier notNullAddress(address someone) {\n        if (someone == address(0)) revert(\"can't be zero address\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Checks whether token config exists by checking whether asset is null address\n     * @dev address can't be null, so it's suitable to be used to check the validity of the config\n     * @param asset asset address\n     */\n    modifier checkTokenConfigExistence(address asset) {\n        if (tokenConfigs[asset].asset == address(0)) revert(\"token config must exist\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    /// @notice Constructor for the implementation contract.
